# MIT 6.00.1x

This repository contains all the assignments that I've completed following the [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python (6.00.1x)](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-using-python-0) course offered by MIT. All assignments are written in Python and some assignments utilize pylab in order to plot data.
